# Quadtree Test (p5.js)
I've always been fascinated by boids and emergent behavior. I wanted to explore this further by creating a simple quadtree implementation to use in future projects!

**quadtree.js** is a simple quadtree implementation in JavaScript.

**sketch.js** is a simple p5.js sketch that draws the movings points and the quadtree.
